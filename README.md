# KNN-diabetes-check
First machine learning model I built

# Goal:
Takes in the health conditions of people and predict whether ths person has diabetes or not using KNN

# What I learned:
- How to import the data
- How to clean the imported dataset
- Steps to training a machine learning model
- Making a machine learning model is not as hard as it sounds
- Models are always evaluated

# Possible extensions in the future:
Have multiple diseases in the training dataset and have the model classify which disease might be concerned based on the person's health conditions
